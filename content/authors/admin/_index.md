Damla Senol Cali is a Ph.D. candidate in the SAFARI Research Group @ Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Prof. Onur Mutlu and Dr. Saugata Ghose. Her research focuses on hardware/software co-design for accelerating bioinformatics applications and computational methods for the analysis of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and nanopore sequencing data. She is also excited about memory systems and processing-in-memory.
